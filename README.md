## Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Balaje and I am a Math PhD student at the University of Newcastle, Australia. I am originally from India and I did my Masters from BITS Pilani K.K.Birla Goa Campus. You can check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=h_FPNVAAAAAJ&hl=en) if you want to have a look at my papers. Or if you want to know what I am working on, check out my [website :black_nib:](https://balaje.github.io).
